This main database for structural data is called the PDB (protein data bank). Let's see what it contains:

Data from:https://www.rcsb.org/stats/

Read this into R
```{r}
pdbdb <- read.csv("Data Export Summary.csv",row.names = 1)
pdbdb
```
and answer the following questions:

```{r}
pdbdb$Total
```
I need to remove the comma and convert to numeric to do math:
```{r}
as.numeric(sub(",","",pdbdb$Total))
```
I could turn this into a function to fix the whole table or any future table I read like this:
```{r}
x <- pdbdb$Total
as.numeric(sub(",","",x))
```

```{r}
comma2numeric <- function(x){
  as.numeric(sub(",","",x))
}
```
Test it
```{r}
comma2numeric(pdbdb$X.ray)
```
```{r}
apply(pdbdb,2, comma2numeric)
```
##Or try a different read/import function:

```{r}
library(readr)
pdbdb <- read_csv("Data Export Summary.csv")
```
```{r}
sum(pdbdb$Total)
```

>Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy.

```{r}
(sum(pdbdb$`X-ray`)+sum(pdbdb$EM))/sum(pdbdb$Total)*100
```

>Q2: What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?

```{r}
pdbdb$Total[1]/sum(pdbdb$Total)
```

>Q3: Type HIV in the PDB website search box on the home page and determine how many HIV-1 protease structures are in the current PDB?

226,414


##Mol*
Mol* (pronounced "molstar") is a new web-based molecular viewer that we will need to learn the basics of here.

https://molstar.org/viewer/

We will use PDB code: 1HSG

>Q4: Water molecules normally have 3 atoms. Why do we see just one atom per water molecule in this structure?

The water molecules are in ball & stick representation, where H atoms are not displayed.

>Q5: There is a critical “conserved” water molecule in the binding site. Can you identify this water molecule? What residue number does this water molecule have

HOH 308.

>Q6: Generate and save a figure clearly showing the two distinct chains of HIV-protease along with the ligand. You might also consider showing the catalytic residues ASP 25 in each chain and the critical water (we recommend “Ball & Stick” for these side-chains). Add this figure to your Quarto document.

##The Bio3D package

The bio3d package allows us to do all sorts of strucutral bioinformatics work in R.

Let's start with how it cna read these PDB ifles:

```{r}
library(bio3d)
pdb <- read.pdb("1hsg")
pdb
```
```{r}
attributes(pdb)
```
```{r}
head(pdb$atom)
```
```{r}
pdbseq(pdb)[25]
```
>Q7: How many amino acid residues are there in this pdb object? 

```{r}
sum(pdb$calpha)
length(pdbseq(pdb))
```

>Q8: Name one of the two non-protein residues? 

HOH and MK1

>Q9: How many protein chains are in this structure? 

2

```{r}
unique(pdb$atom$chain)
```

##Predicting functional motions of a single structure

Let's do a bioinformatics prediction of functional motions-i.e. the movements that one of these molecules needs to make to do its stuff.

```{r}
adk <- read.pdb("6s36")
adk
```

```{r}
# Perform flexiblity prediction
m <- nma(adk)
plot(m)
```

Write out multi-model PDB file (trajectory) that we can use to make an animation of the predicted motion. 
```{r}
mktrj(m, file="adk.pdb")
```

I can open this in Mol* to play the trajectory...

##Comparative analysis of protein structures

```{r}
library(bio3d)
```

Here we will find and analyze all ADK structures in the PDB database.

We will start with a single data base accession id: "1ake_A"

```{r}
id<-"1ake_A"
aa <- get.seq(id)
```
I ran these cmds in the R brain/console
install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install("msa")

>Q10. Which of the packages above is found only on BioConductor and not CRAN? 

The `msa` package is form BioConductor.


>Q13. How many amino acids are in this sequence, i.e. how long is this sequence?

214

```{r}
attributes(aa)
```
```{r}
aa$ali
```
```{r}
#b <- blast.pdb(aa)
#hits <- plot(b)
#head(hits$pdb.id)
```

Pre-calculated resutls:

```{r}
hits <- NULL
hits$pdb.id <- c('1AKE_A','6S36_A','6RZE_A','3HPR_A','1E4V_A','5EJE_A','1E4Y_A','3X2S_A','6HAP_A','6HAM_A','4K46_A','3GMT_A','4PZL_A')
files <- get.pdb(hits$pdb.id, path="pdbs", split=TRUE, gzip=TRUE)
```
Next we will use the pdbaln() function to align and also optionally fit (i.e. superpose) the identified PDB structures.


```{r}
# Align releated PDBs
pdbs <- pdbaln(files, fit = TRUE, exefile="msa")
pdbs
```

##Principal component analysis

```{r}
# Perform PCA
pc.xray <- pca(pdbs)
plot(pc.xray,pc.axes=c(1,2))
```
To visualize the major structural variations in the ensemble the function mktrj() can be used to generate a trajectory PDB file by interpolating along a give PC (eigenvector):

```{r}
pc1 <- mktrj(pc.xray, pc=1, file="pc_1.pdb")

```


```{r}
uniprot<-248838887
pdb <- 195610
pdb/uniprot*100
```
